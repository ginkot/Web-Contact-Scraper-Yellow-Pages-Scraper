[About]

Web Contact Scraper allows you to retrieve thousands of business contact information entries in real-time. You can use this information to start your very own business campaign. Are you a new business owner? Want to advertise to other similar businesses to promote yourself or a service? Then Web Contact Scraper is for you!

Web Contact Scraper allows you to set multiple business key words and locations within a single search. For example, you can search for: Construction, Plumbing, Electricians, Building, Landscaping in all 50 states! While this search may take a little time to complete, you can leave the application running while you see results appear in real-time! No more waiting for long queries to complete!

For large search operations, you can opt to export your results in real-time to CSV files. The software can split CSV files based on search term, search area or both!

You can leave YellowPages and Yelp searches running simultaneously! Web Contact Scraper is fully multi-threaded, no application freezing or hanging!

You may choose to export your results to CSV any time!

Searches can be paused and resumed with ease. This is especially useful when executing a very large search operation. The software supports recalling up to 10 previous partial search operations.

Any internet outage or drops in internet service do not affect searches in progress. The software is intelligent enough to detect this and automatically proceeds once the internet connection has been restored.

Web Contact Scraper includes intelligent proxy support to build your business databases anonymously! You can input a list of proxy servers, and it will skip proxies that are either too slow or do not work. It will focus on getting your results fast using the proxies that do work, and work well.
